# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **Hybrid search indexing consistency**: Fixed hybrid search to use the same efficient v3 semantic indexing as semantic search mode, eliminating redundant index rebuilds and improving performance consistency
- **Directory validation**: Fixed issue where searching non-existent directories would silently fall back to parent directory indexes instead of showing clear error messages
- **Output stream separation**: All progress indicators and status messages now correctly output to stderr instead of stdout, ensuring clean output for piping and scripts
- **NaN sort handling**: Fixed edge cases with NaN values in similarity scoring that could cause inconsistent results

### Added
- **File listing flags**: Added grep-compatible `-l/--files-with-matches` and `-L/--files-without-matches` flags for listing filenames only
- **Enhanced visual output**: Implemented sophisticated match highlighting with color-coded similarity heatmaps using RGB gradients
- **Better user experience**: Added "No matches found" message to stderr when no results are found, improving clarity for users
- **Improved error handling**: Enhanced directory traversal error handling and graceful degradation for individual file failures
- **Incremental indexing**: Smart hash-based index updates that only reprocess changed files, dramatically improving index update performance

### Improved  
- **Indexing strategy optimization**: Smart embedding computation that only processes embeddings when needed for semantic/hybrid search, dramatically improving performance for regex-only workflows
- **Semantic search v3**: New implementation using pre-computed embeddings from sidecar files with span-based content extraction
- **Test infrastructure**: Enhanced integration tests with better binary path resolution and more resilient semantic search testing
- **Code quality**: Removed unused code, fixed compiler warnings, and improved error messaging throughout the codebase

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- Major improvements to CLI functionality
- Full-section feature implementation (`--full-section` flag)
- Comprehensive testing suite (40+ tests)
- Smart exclusion patterns for Python virtual environments and build artifacts
- Installation script with PATH setup (`install.sh`)

### Fixed
- CLI flag conflict: changed `-h` to `--no-filename` to avoid help conflict
- Proper handling of files with no filename
- File exclusion functionality during index creation
- Enhanced semantic search to return complete code sections

### Improved
- Updated documentation (README.md, PRD.txt) to reflect current implementation status
- Marked milestones M0-M5 as completed in project roadmap

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Initial version of ck project with core functionality
- Drop-in grep compatibility with semantic search capabilities
- Basic regex, semantic, lexical, and hybrid search modes
- JSON output format for agent-friendly integration
