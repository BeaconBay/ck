## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install ck-search

# CLI: Command-line search (grep-compatible)
ck --sem "error handling" src/
ck --hybrid "connection timeout" src/
ck -n "TODO" *.rs

# TUI: Interactive terminal UI
ck-tui
# Type queries, see live results, navigate with ↑/↓

# Editor: VSCode/Cursor extension
code --install-extension ck-search
# Press Cmd+Shift+; to search

# MCP: AI agent integration
ck --serve
# Configure in Claude Desktop for AI-assisted search
```

## Why ck?

**ck (seek)** finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It’s the grep you wish you had:

- 🎯 **Understand intent** – Search for “error handling” and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handling even when those exact words aren’t present
- 🤖 **AI-first** – Built-in MCP server for direct integration with AI coding assistants
- ⚡ **Fast & efficient** – Automatic incremental indexing, sub-second queries
- 🔧 **Drop-in replacement** – Works exactly like grep/ripgrep with all the flags you know
- 🌐 **Multi-language** – Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Go, Ruby, Haskell, C#, and more
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – 100% offline, no telemetry, no external API calls
