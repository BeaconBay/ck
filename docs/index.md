# ck - Semantic Code Search

**ck (seek)** finds code by meaning, not just keywords. Search for "error handling" and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handlingâ€”even when those exact words aren't present.

```bash
# Install
cargo install ck-search

# Search by meaning
ck --sem "authentication logic" src/

# Interactive TUI
ck --tui .

# AI agent integration
ck --serve
```
